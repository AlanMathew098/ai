                                If you enjoy owning the most important problems end-to-end and have high curiosity and willingness to pick up whatever knowledge that’s missing to get the job done, you will find our work here uniquely challenging and rewarding.</p>
                            <h4>We expect you to: </h4>
                        <P>Have at least 3 years professional experience as a software engineer</P>
                        <P>Have strong engineering skills, such as system design, creating highly scalable services, front/backend systems, reliability, debugging</P>
                        <p>Have proficiency in Python, JavaScript, React, and/or other programming languages</p>
                        <p>Have experience driving large-scale projects in a fast-paced and highly collaborative environment</p>
                        <P>Be interested in and thoughtful about the impacts of AI technology (see our Charter for examples of our goals)</P>
                        <br>
                        <p>We are an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability or other legally protected statuses. Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records. 

                            We are committed to providing reasonable accommodations to applicants with disabilities, and requests can be made via accommodation@openai.com.</p>
                            <h4>About Opac</h4><p>As a Research Engineer here, you will be responsible for building AI systems that can perform previously impossible tasks or achieve unprecedented levels of performance. We're looking for people with solid engineering skills (for example designing, implementing, and improving a massive-scale distributed machine learning system), writing bug-free machine learning code, and building the science behind the algorithms employed. <br>

                              The most outstanding deep learning results are increasingly attained at a massive scale, and these results require engineers who are comfortable working in large distributed systems. We expect engineering to play a key role in most major advances in AI of the future.</p>

We put an emphasis on solutions that scale well as models become more capable - our strategy is to have AI models both learning from human feedback and helping humans in their day to day.  For an example of recent work, see our paper on critiques. <br>  
                                <h4 class="my-4">About the Role</h4><p>Create great UI experiences: for both labeling tasks (e.g. humans giving feedback on model outputs) and internal dashboards (e.g. researchers browsing the data collected)</p>
                                <p>Improve our data collection processes:  create workflows for onboarding labelers, giving feedback on their work, and ensuring high quality outputs.</p>
                                <p>Design and implement infrastructure for live interaction between humans and models (e.g. models assisting humans, humans red-teaming models)</p>
                                <p>Explore tools that use machine learning models to help humans think, write, code, do research, etc. </p>

We're looking for people with solid engineering skills (for example designing, implementing, and improving a massive-scale distributed machine learning system), writing bug-free machine learning code, and building the science behind the algorithms employed. <br>

                                  The most outstanding deep learning results are increasingly attained at a massive scale, and these results require engineers who are comfortable working in large distributed systems. We expect engineering to play a key role in most major advances in AI of the future.</p>

Our Applied AI team deploys our advanced AI systems into the world by building great products. We serve a diverse audience, from developers building on our API to creatives using DALL·E to visualize their imagination.<br>

                                Developers are using our API to build incredible next-gen applications powered by our models that can understand and generate natural language text, code, and images. For example, we launched Copilot, an AI pair programmer, in partnership with GitHub last year.<br>
                                
                                Earlier this year, we also introduced DALL·E 2, our AI system that can create and edit images based on a text description. The Verge called it “a breakthrough in the history of consumer tech” and “the sort of nascent technology that made me call my friends and say: you’ve got to see this.”<br>
                                
                                Most recently, we released ChatGPT, an early research preview that lets people interact with its model in a conversational way.  <br>   <h4 class="my-2"> About the Role </h4>
                                  <p>Design plays a critical role here. To succeed in our mission, it’s crucial that we make our technology intuitive and accessible. We’re hiring a product designer to create products that are easy to use, beautiful, and push the boundaries of what’s possible. As an early team member, you’ll have a huge part in shaping our product direction and design culture. </p>
                                  <p>In this role, you’ll work closely with our Human Data team. OpenAI is on the cutting edge of AI development, and we’re excited to be developing methods for steering AI behavior based on small amounts of input from human teachers. You might be familiar with ChatGPT, which has become helpful and compliant thanks to human feedback.

                                  </p>
                                  <p>We believe human input is crucial for creating useful and safe AI systems, but it’s not easy! The task of giving feedback on increasingly capable AI models is challenging, which is where you come in. You’ll work with our Human Data team to design the interfaces and workflows that make it easy and intuitive for humans to teach our AI models. </p><br>

                                Our customers build fast-growing businesses around our APIs, which power product features that were never before possible. We simultaneously ensure that our powerful tools are used responsibly. Safe deployment is more important to us than unfettered growth.<br>
                                
                                The Applied Engineering team wraps a massive fleet of GPUs in scalable, robust, infrastructure powered by Kubernetes, Go, Python, Terraform, Redis, Kafka, Postgres, and Snowflake. Our APIs are powered by Python Flask and OpenAPI with a React frontend.

                                  <p>To help API users monitor and prevent unwanted use cases, we developed the moderation endpoint, a tool for checking whether content complies with OpenAI's content policy. Developers can thus identify content that our content policy prohibits and take actions (e.g. block it). We seek a Machine Learning Engineer to help design and build a robust pipeline for data management, model training and deployment to enable a consistent improvement on the Moderation model.  </p>
                                  <p>Design, develop and maintain a robust and scalable data management pipeline and set up standards for versioning and data quality control. The pipeline should be able to handle data relabeling requests due to content policy changes.</p>
                                  <p>Build a pipeline for automated model training, evaluation and deployment, including active learning process, routines for calibration and validation data refresh etc. </p>
                              <p>Work closely with stakeholders from product, engineering, content policy on a long-term improvement over the moderation models, for both external release and internal use cases across a variety of projects on model safety.</p>
                              <p>Research on the latest techniques and methods in deep learning and natural language processing to improve the moderation model across a collection of unwanted content categories.</p> 
                              <p>Experiment on data augmentation and data generation methods to enhance the diversity and quality of training data.</p>
                              <p>Experiment and design an effective red-teaming pipeline to examine the robustness of the model and identify areas for future improvement.</p>
                              <p>Conduct open-ended research to improve the quality of collected data, including but not limited to, semi-supervised learning and human-in-the-loop machine learning.</p><br>
  
                              <h4>About Opac</h4><p>As a Research Engineer here, you will be responsible for building AI systems that can perform previously impossible tasks or achieve unprecedented levels of performance. We're looking for people with solid engineering skills (for example designing, implementing, and improving a massive-scale distributed machine learning system), writing bug-free machine learning code, and building the science behind the algorithms employed.</p> <br>
